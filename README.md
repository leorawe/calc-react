# React Calculator 
Added buttons and the screen.  Thinking through the logic: get n/a when try to divide by zero. 
Decimals work.  
Used styled-components for theming.  

--> need to organize the styles  
--> button when selected have blue border - why?
--> deploy - where?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
